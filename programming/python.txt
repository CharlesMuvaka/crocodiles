                    INTRODUCTION
- Automation refers to any technology that removes any human interaction from a system.
- Scripts are written to automate labor-intensive tasks.
- A programing language communicates instructions to a computer.
- A set of instructions that tell what a computer is supposed to do is a program.
- Compilers and interpreters transform the programming language into machine code that can be understood
  by the computer.
    NOTE: Compilers transform the language at once into machine code before it runs while
          an interpreter translates line after line while the program runs.
- A data type is classification of data that tells the computer how a programmer intends to use the data.
    NOTE: Some languages need the programmer to explicitly define the datatype of a variable while
           others don't. The compiler understands the data type inferred based on the syntax used.
- Variables are containers for storing data.
    - variables should be assigned values using the assignment operator.
- American Standards Association of Information Interchange is a system that associates encoding characters into a
computer.

            Composite and Primitive Data types
- Primitives are data types built on a specific programming language without modification.
- Composites is a combination of primitive data types to form a single unit(Classes)

            Collections
- They group different variables in a single unit.
- Examples;
        1. Arrays - An ordered collection of the same type
        2. Sets - An ordered collection that doesn't contain duplicates
        3. Lists - An ordered collection that can contain duplicates and can be of different types.
        4. Dictionaries - Used to store key value pairs
        3. Hashes -
        4. Vectors -
        5. Queues -
        6. Dequeues -

            Conditions
  if statements
- You can use if statements to check if certain conditions in your condition.
- An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement that contains code to be
    executed when the if statement fails.
    NOTE: An if statement should only contain one else statement. An If statement can also occur
            without an else statement.
- Elif statements can be added to compare if the conditions to be tested are more than one.
- Example;
        name = "james"
        if  name.isNotNull:
           print "I am charles."
        elif name.isNotBlank:
            print "I am Kata."
        else:
            print "I am Muvaka."


  SWitch statements
- Used to test multiple cases of a value
- Example;
        switch(sign):
            case "stop": pauseBreak()
            case "merge": accelerate()
            default: addNitro()

        Loops
- Enable execution of code in a multiple number of times.
    For loops
- Enable execution of code in a known number of times.
- Examples;
        names = {"charles", "Muvaka", "Kata"}
        for name in names:
            newName = capitalize(name)
            print(newName)
